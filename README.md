Auth Service
Overview
This Auth Service is a microservice designed to handle user authentication and authorization. It is a key part of a larger system that is currently in progress. As a microservice, it will be integrated with other services such as an API Gateway and will leverage Kafka for communication and scalability.

The service is still under development, with Docker integration and additional features coming soon to support easier deployment and scaling across environments.

Features
User Authentication: Supports sign-up, login, and JWT token generation for secure user sessions.

Integration with Kafka: Communication with other services will be facilitated via Kafka for message queuing and asynchronous processing.

API Gateway Integration: The service is intended to be used with an API Gateway for routing, authentication, and load balancing across services.

Current State
This project is still in progress. The core authentication functionality is in place, but there are planned features and enhancements to be rolled out.

Docker integration is coming soon to facilitate deployment across different environments (development, testing, production).
